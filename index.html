            <h2>Who is Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khawarizmi?</h2>

            <p>I would like the excerpts below from the preface to 'The Algebra of Mohammed Ben Musa' (by Friedrich August Rosen, <a href="https://books.google.com.sa/books/about/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B1_%D9%81%D9%89_%D8%AD%D8%B3%D8%A7.html?id=geTuAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">available as a free ebook</a>) to serve as an introduction to Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khawarizmi.</p>
    
            <blockquote>
    
                <p>In the study of history, the attention of the observer is drawn by a peculiar charm towards those epochs, at which nations, after having secured their independence externally, strive to obtain an inward guarantee for their power, by acquiring eminence as great in science and in every art of peace as they have already attained in the field of war. Such an epoch was, in the history of the Arabs, that of the Caliphs AL MANSUR, HARUN AL RASHID, and AL MAMUN, the illustrious contemporaries of CHARLEMAGNE; to the glory of which era, in the volume now offered to the public, a new monument is endeavoured to be raised.</p>
    
                <p>ABU ABDALLAH MOHAMMED BEN MUSA, of Khowarezm, who it appears, from his preface, wrote this Treatise at the command of the Caliph AL MAMUN, was for a long time considered as the original inventor of Algebra. <em>“Hacars olim a MAHOMETE MOSIS Arabis filio, initium sumsit: etenim hujus rei locuples testis LEONARDUs PISANUS.”</em> Such are the words with which HIERONYMUS CARDANUS commences his Ars Magna, in which he frequently refers to the work here translated, in a manner to leave no doubt of its identity.</p>
        
                <p>The science as taught by MOHAMMED BEN MUSA, in the treatise now before us, does not extend beyond quadratic equations, including
                problems with an affected square. These he solves by the same rules which are followed by DIOPHANTUS, and which are taught, though less comprehensively, by the Hindu mathematicians. That he should have borrowed from DIOPHANTUS is not at all probable; for it does not appear that the Arabs had any knowledge of DIOPHANTUS’ work before the middle of the fourth century after the Hejira, when ABU’L WAFA BUZJANI rendered it into Arabic. It is far more probable that the Arabs received their first knowledge of Algebra from the Hindus, who furnished them with the decimal notation of numerals, and with various important points of mathematical and astronomical information.</p>
        
                <p>But under whatever obligation our author may be to the Hindus, as to the subject matter of his performance, he seems to have been independent of them in the manner of digesting and treating it : at least the method which he follows in expounding his rules, as well as in showing their application, differs considerably from that of the Hindu mathematical writers. BHASKARA and BRAHMAGUPTA give dogmatical precepts, unsupported by argument, which, even by the metrical form in which they are expressed, seem to address themselves rather to the memory than to the reasoning faculty of the learner: MOHAMMED gives his rules in simple prose, and establishes their accuracy by geometrical illustrations. The Hindus give comparatively few examples, and are fond of investing the statement of their problems in rhetorical pomp: the Arab, on the contrary, is remarkably rich in examples, but he introduces them with the same perspicuous simplicity of style which distinguishes his rules. In solving their problems, the Hindus are satisfied with pointing at the result, and at the principal intermediate steps which lead to it: the Arab shows the working of each example at full length, keeping his view constantly fixed upon the two sides of the equation, as upon the two scales of a balance, and showing how any alteration in one side is counterpoised by a corresponding change in the other.</p>

            <h2>His Life</h2>
    
            <p>His full name is Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi. The last-mentioned name (his nisba) refers to his birthplace, Khwarizm, modern Khiva, south of the Aral Sea. He was born around 780 in the town of Kath part of Khwarizm. Kath is now buried in the sand. He died around 850. He was summoned to Baghdad by Caliph Al-Ma’mun and appointed court astronomer. Al-Khwarizmi was one of the learned men who worked in the House of Wisdom. Al-Khwarizmi flourished while working as a member of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad under the leadership of Kalif al-Mamun, the son of the Khalif Harun al-Rashid, who was made famous in the Arabian Nights. The House of Wisdom was a scientific research and teaching center.</p>
    
            <h2>His Contributions and Achievements</h2>

            <p>From the title of his work, Hisab Al-Jabr wal Muqabalah (Book of Calculations, Restoration and Reduction), Algebra (Al-Jabr) derived its name. Algebra symbolises the debt of Western culture (and by extension modern science) to Muslim mathematics. Ironically, when it first entered the English language it was used as a term for the setting of broken bones, and even sometimes for the fractures themselves. This reflects the original literal meaning of the Arabic word “Jabr,” ‘reuniting of broken bones,’ from the verb jabara (to reunite). The anatomical connotations of this meaning were adopted when the word was borrowed, as algebra, into Spanish, Italian and Medieval Latin from one or other of which English acquired it. In Arabic, however, it had long been applied to the solving of algebraic equations (the full Arabic expression was ‘Ilm al-jabr wa’-l-muqabalah’, literally ‘the science of reunion and equations,’ and the mathematician Al-Khwarizmi used al-jabr as the title of his treatise on algebra. In the twelfth century Gerard of Cremona and Robert of Chester translated the algebra of Al-Khwarizmi into Latin. Mathematicians used it all over the world until the sixteenth century.</p>
    
            <p>A Latin translation of a Muslim arithmetic text was discovered in 1857 CE at the University of Cambridge library. Entitled ‘Algoritimi de Numero Indorum‘, the work opens with the words: ‘Spoken has Algoritimi. Let us give deserved praise to God, our Leader and Defender’. It is believed that this is a copy of Al-Khwarizmi’s arithmetic text, which was translated into Latin in the twelfth century by Adelard of Bath, an English scholar. Al-Khwarizmi gave his name to the history of mathematics in the form of Algorism (the old name for arithmetic).</p>
    
            <p>His most recognized work as mentioned above and one that is so named after him is the mathematical concept Algorithm. The modern meaning of the word relates to a specific practice for solving a particular problem. Today, people use algorithms to do addition and long division, principles that are found in Al-Khwarizmi’s text written about 1200 years ago. Al-Khwarizmi was also responsible for introducing the Arabic numbers to the West, setting in motion a process that led to the use of the nine Arabic numerals, together with the zero sign.</p>
    
            <p>Of great importance also was al-Khwarizmi’s contribution to medieval geography. He systematized and corrected Ptolemy’s research in geography, using his own original findings that are entitled as Surat al-Ard (The Shape of the Earth). The text exists in a manuscript; the maps have unfortunately not been preserved, although modern scholars have been able to reconstruct them from al-Khwarizmi’s descriptions. He supervised the work of 70 geographers to create a map of the then “known world”. When his work became known in Europe through Latin translations, his influence made a permanent mark on the development of science in the West.</p>
    
            <p>Al-Khwarizmi made several important improvements to the theory and construction of sundials, which he inherited from his Indian and Hellenistic predecessors. He made tables for these instruments which considerably shortened the time needed to make specific calculations. His sundial was universal and could be observed from anywhere on the Earth. From then on, sundials were frequently placed on mosques to determine the time of prayer. The shadow square, an instrument used to determine the linear height of an object, in conjunction with the alidade for angular observations, was also invented by al-Khwarizmi in ninth-century Baghdad.</p>
    
            <p>He developed in detail trigonometric tables containing the sine functions, which were probably extrapolated to tangent functions by Maslama.</p>
    
            <p>He also perfected the geometric representation of conic sections and developed the calculus of two errors, which practically led him to the concept of differentiation. He is also reported to have collaborated in the degree measurements ordered by Al-Mamun which were aimed at measuring of volume and circumference of the earth.</p>
    
            <p>While his major contributions were the result of original research, he also did much to synthesize the existing knowledge in these fields from Greek, Indian, and other sources. A number of minor works were written by al-Khwarizmi on topics such as the astrolabe, on which he wrote on the Jewish calendar. He also wrote a political history containing horoscopes of prominent persons.</p>
    
            <h2>A Servant of God</h2>
    
            <p>Al-Khwarizmi emphasised that he wrote his algebra book to serve the practical needs of the people concerning the matters of inheritance, legacies, partition, law suits and commerce. He considered his work as worship to God. Below is the translation of his original preface to one of his most prominent works, 'Al Kitab Al Mukhtasir Fi Hisaab Al Jabr wa Al Muqaabla'.</p>
    
            <blockquote>
                <p>In The Name of God, Gracious and Merciful!</p>        
    
                <p>Praised be God for His bounty towards those who deserve it by their virtuous acts: in performing which, as by Him prescribed to his adoring creatures, we express our thanks, and render ourselves worthy of the continuance (of His mercy), and preserve ourselves from change: acknowledging His might, bending before His power, and revering His greatness He sent Muhammad (on whom may the blessing of God repose!) with the mission of a prophet, long after any messenger from above had appeared, when justice had fallen into neglect, and when the true way of life was sought for in vain. Through him he cured of blindness, and saved through him from perdition, and increased through him what before was small, and collected through him what before was scattered. Praised be God our Lord and may His glory increase, and may all His names be hallowed—besides whom there is no God; and may His benediction rest on Muhammad the Prophet and on his descendants!</p>
    
                <p>The learned in times which have passed away, and among nations which have ceased to exist, were constantly employed in writing books on the several departments of science and on the various branches of knowledge, bearing in mind those that were to come after them, and hoping for a reward proportionate to their ability, and trusting that their endeavours would meet with acknowledgment, attention, and remembrance—content as they were even with a small degree of praise; small, if compared with the pains which they had undergone, and the difficulties which they had encountered in revealing the secrets and obscurities of science.</p>
    
                <p>Some applied themselves to obtain information which was not known before them, and left it to posterity; others commented upon the difficulties in the works left by their predecessors, and defined the best method (of study), or rendered the access (to science) easier or placed it more within reach; others again discovered mistakes in preceding works, and arranged that which was confused, or adjusted what was irregular, and corrected the faults of their fellow-labourers, without arrogance towards them, or taking pride in what they did themselves.</p>
    
                <p>That fondness for science, by which God has distinguished the IMAM AL MAMUN, the Commander of the Faithful (besides the caliphat which He has vouchsafed unto him by lawful succession, in the robe of which He has invested him, and with the honours of which He has adorned him), that affability and condescension which he shows to the learned, that promptitude with which he protects and supports them in the elucidation of obscurities and in the removal of difficulties, —has encouraged me to compose a short work on Calculating by (the rules of) Completion and Reduction, confining it to what is easiest and most useful in arithmetic, such as men constantly require in cases of inheritance, legacies, partition, law-suits, and trade, and in all their dealings with one another, or where the measuring of lands, the digging of canals, geometrical computation, and other objects of various sorts and kinds are concerned—relying on the goodness of my intention therein, and hoping that the learned will reward it, by obtaining (for me) through their prayers the excellence of the Divine mercy: in requital of which, may the choicest blessings and the abundant bounty of God be theirs! My confidence rests with God, in this as in everything, and in Him I put my trust. He is the Lord of the Sublime Throne. May His blessing descend upon all the prophets and heavenly messengers!</p>
